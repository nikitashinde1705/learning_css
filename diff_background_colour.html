        <p>Rock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from Neolithic times.
             Ladakh's earliest inhabitants consisted of nomads known as Kampa.[31] Later settlements were established
              by Mons from Kullu and Brokpas who originated from Gilgit.[31] Around the 1st century, Ladakh was a part
               of the Kushan Empire. Buddhism spread into western Ladakh from Kashmir in the 2nd century. The 7th-century 
               Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes the region in his accounts.[32] Xuanzang's term of Ladakh is Mo-lo-so, 
               which has been reconstructed by academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa, which is believed to have been 
               the original name of the region.[33][34]</p>
