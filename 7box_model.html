    <p class="box_model_para">The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.
         The Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains 
         the Suru, Dras and Zanskar river valleys. The main populated regions are the river valleys, but 
         the mountain slopes also support pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups in the region
          are Muslims (mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan Buddhists) (40%), and Hindus (12%) with
           the remaining 2% made of other religions.[20][21] Ladakh is both the largest and the second least 
           populous union territory of India.[22] Its culture and history are closely related to those of Tibet.</p>

    <p class="box_model_para2">For much of the first millennium, western Tibet comprised Zhangzhung kingdom(s), which practised
     the Bon religion. Sandwiched between Kashmir and Zhangzhung, Ladakh is believed to have been alternatively under the
      control of one or other of these powers. Academics find strong influences of Zhangzhung language and culture in "upper Ladakh" 
      (from the middle section of the Indus valley to the southeast).<sup>[35]</sup> The penultimate king of Zhangzhung is said to have been
       from Ladakh</p>
